MouseWheel Xtrav 1.4 feb07© Antoine Schmitt 2005-2008
---------- Synopsis ----------The ÇÊMouseWheelÊÈ Xtra allows lingo to get access to mouse wheel events.

This Xtra was inspired by the Wheel Mouse Xtra of Gary Smith, which works only on Windows (http://www.mods.com.au/)
The Wheel Mouse on Windows and the MouseWheel on Macintosh have the same APIs and behavior.

--------- Installation ----------Copy the xtra file into the Director Xtra folder.For Director <= MX 2004, use the 'MouseWheelXtra' file
For Director >= D11, use the 'MouseWheelXtra.xtra' file
---------- API ----------

This API is the same as the Wheel Mouse of Gary Smith (http://www.mods.com.au/)startWheelMouse()
Initializes the Xtra. After this call, the Xtra will call the "WheelMouseEvent" (see below) handler for each movement of the mouse. Returns 1 if success or an error code if an error occurred.

closeWheelMouse()
Closes the Xtra. The "WheelMouseEvent" handler is not called any more. Returns 1 if success or an error code if an error occurred.

After the startWheelMouse call has been made, the Xtra calls the animation lingo handler "WheelMouseEvent" each time the wheel is moved. The handler is called with one argument : an integer representing the amount of mouvement of the wheel. A value of 120 will be equivalent to one wheel 'click'.

---------- Error codes ----------

-1		// "MouseWheel Xtra already started"-2		// "MouseWheel Xtra not started"-3		// "MouseWheel Xtra expired"-4		// "MouseWheel Xtra initialisation error"
